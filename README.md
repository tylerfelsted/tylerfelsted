I am a full-stack web developer, skilled in JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL, and I have experience programming in fast paced, high stress environments through nearly 9 years of participation in the FIRST Robotics Competition.

I have a genuine love of analyzing, understanding, fixing, and building both hardware and software technology. I decided to kickstart my career in software development by enrolling in the Spring Board Software Engineering Track.

My devotion to software engineering and robotics comes from my fascination with science and constant curiosity about how things work. I have pursued my love of programming and robotics through both regional and international competitions with FIRST Robotics and Team 1902 Exploding Bacon, where I have had the pleasure of being both a programming team member as well as a mentor.
